# Boundaries

NeuroForge development is active beyond Stage C v1, exploring **Phase 6 (Hybrid Reasoning)** and **M7 (Autonomy)** capabilities.

The system learns, explains, evaluates its own changes, and can translate performance into increased authority within defined safety envelopes.

Safety is maintained via **Phase 13 (Autonomy Envelope)** and **Phase 15 (Ethics Regulator)**, which provide hard boundaries on autonomous action regardless of the reasoning capability.
