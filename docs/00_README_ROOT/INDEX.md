# Entry Index (Front Door)

This directory is the minimal entry point for first-time serious readers. It is intentionally tiny.

## Read In This Order
- `README.md` — what NeuroForge is, at a high level
- `WHY_NOT_LLM.md` — what this is trying to solve that LLM framing obscures
- `CORE_PRINCIPLES.md` — non-negotiable architectural constraints
- `GLOSSARY.md` — definitions used consistently across the repo
- `HOW_TO_READ_THIS.md` — suggested reading paths by audience

## Note
- This folder is meant to contain ≤ 5 documents total. If a topic grows, it belongs in `01_FOUNDATION/` or deeper strata.
