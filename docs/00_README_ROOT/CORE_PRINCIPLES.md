# Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

- Architecture-first, not results-first
- Persist internal signals across runs (audit trail matters)
- Keep explanations coupled to meaningful internal changes
- Keep self-modification bounded, rate-limited, and safety-checked
- Separate triggers, metrics, explanations, and revisions to preserve interpretability
- Prefer traceability and reproducibility over novelty
- Treat failures as first-class experimental artifacts
- Declare status clearly: foundational research prototype — not a product
