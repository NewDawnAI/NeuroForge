# Glossary

- Cognitive architecture: a system organized as interacting control loops over persistent state.
- Telemetry: structured logging of internal signals for later inspection and replay.
- Metacognition: internal measurements about the system’s own reliability signals (e.g., trust/coherence trends).
- Self-explanation: a structured narrative artifact that justifies a trigger or internal change.
- Self-revision: a bounded proposal to adjust internal parameters under explicit safety constraints.
- Audit trail: persisted record of “what changed, what triggered it, and why it was considered safe.”
- Foundational research prototype: an evolving research system; not a product, not a stable API promise.
