# NeuroForge (Front Door)

NeuroForge is a cognitive architecture research system aimed at building agents whose internal state, internal change, and internal justifications are observable and auditable over time.

Status: Foundational research prototype — not a product.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

NeuroForge focuses on the gap between “an agent did something” and “we can explain what changed inside the agent and why.” The project treats auditability, persistence, and bounded adaptation as first-class goals.

## What Makes It Different?

- Architecture-first: structured loops and interfaces before benchmark claims
- Persistent telemetry: internal signals are logged for later inspection and replay
- Explainable adaptation: meaningful internal changes are accompanied by structured explanations
- Safety-bounded self-modification: adaptation is constrained and rate-limited

## What It Is Not

- Not an ML library or training framework
- Not a product agent SDK
- Not a benchmark-first model release
- Not a biologically faithful brain simulation

This is a cognitive architecture research system, not a library or product.
