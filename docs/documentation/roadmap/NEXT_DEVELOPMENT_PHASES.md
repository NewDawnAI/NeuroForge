# NeuroForge Next Development Phases
## Post Neural Substrate Migration Roadmap

**Status**: Neural Substrate Migration COMPLETE ✅  
**Date**: January 2025  
**All 7 Core Systems**: Fully Operational and Integrated

---

## Governance (Future Work)
- Stage C v2: Learning from self-revision outcomes (not started)

## Stage C v1 — Freeze Criteria (Governance-Only)

### Definition of “Frozen” (Scope Lock)

A **Stage C v1 freeze** means:

> *The autonomy-gating mechanism is considered correct, stable, and non-escalatory, and will not be changed except for bug fixes.*

No feature growth.  
No threshold tuning.  
No scope creep.

---

### 1. Behavioral Stability Criteria (Mandatory)

#### C1.1 — Autonomy Cap Stability

✔ Over a **long run (≥10k steps)**:

- Autonomy cap changes **≤1 time**
- No oscillation (`0.75 → 1.0 → 0.75` is disallowed)

**Pass condition:**  
Cap monotonically tightens or remains constant.

#### C1.2 — No Autonomy Expansion Beyond Base

✔ Across all runs:

- `autonomy_cap_multiplier ∈ {0.5, 0.75, 1.0}`
- **Never exceeds 1.0**

**Pass condition:**  
Absolute upper bound is never violated.

#### C1.3 — Neutral Outcome Dominance Is Non-Exploitative

✔ If outcomes are mostly `Neutral`:

- Autonomy remains constrained or unchanged
- No gradual “creep” toward relaxation

**Pass condition:**  
Neutral ≠ reward.

---

### 2. Governance Integrity Criteria (Mandatory)

#### C2.1 — Read-Only Outcome Consumption

✔ Stage C v1:

- Reads from `self_revision_outcomes`
- Does **not** write to:
  - learning parameters
  - trust
  - reward
  - revision logic

**Pass condition:**  
Search for any mutation outside `AutonomyEnvelope` returns **zero hits**.

#### C2.2 — No Learning-from-Outcomes

✔ There is **no gradient**, heuristic adaptation, or memory update that:

- Adjusts thresholds
- Adjusts weights
- Adapts policy based on outcomes

**Pass condition:**  
All mappings are static, explicit, and constant in code.

#### C2.3 — No Revision Triggering

✔ Stage C:

- Cannot initiate self-revision
- Cannot influence revision frequency
- Cannot influence revision magnitude

**Pass condition:**  
Call graph confirms one-way flow:

```
Stage 7.5 → Stage C → AutonomyEnvelope
```

---

### 3. Explainability & Audit Criteria (Mandatory)

#### C3.1 — Explanation Completeness

✔ Every autonomy cap application produces a Phase 10 entry containing:

- `revision_reputation`
- `autonomy_cap_multiplier`
- window size
- human-readable reason

**Pass condition:**  
100% of autonomy changes are explainable.

#### C3.2 — Silent Failure Is Impossible

✔ If Stage C cannot evaluate (e.g. no data):

- Reputation defaults to `0.5`
- Autonomy cap remains unchanged
- Explanation explicitly states “no outcome history”

**Pass condition:**  
No silent “best guess” behavior.

---

### 4. Temporal Discipline Criteria (Mandatory)

#### C4.1 — Update Rate Limit

✔ Stage C runs:

- At most **once per revision cycle**
- Never continuously
- Never inside learning loops

**Pass condition:**  
No autonomy updates appear without a corresponding revision boundary.

#### C4.2 — Causality Order Preserved

✔ Ordering is always:

```
Revision → Evaluation → Governance → Next behavior
```

**Pass condition:**  
No governance decision precedes evaluation.

---

### 5. Code Hygiene Criteria (Mandatory)

#### C5.1 — Isolation

✔ Stage C logic lives in:

- Its own class/module
- Does not sprawl into Phase 7/9/11 logic

**Pass condition:**  
`StageC_*` symbols appear only in governance-related files.

#### C5.2 — Test Coverage

✔ At least:

- One test validating neutral-only history
- One test validating harmful history tightening
- One test validating no-history default behavior

**Pass condition:**  
Tests fail if autonomy escalates improperly.

---

### 6. Documentation Alignment Criteria (Mandatory)

#### C6.1 — Docs Explicitly Say “Governance-Only”

✔ Documentation states:

- Stage C v1 **does not learn**
- Stage C v1 **does not increase autonomy**
- Stage C v1 **is evaluative and constraining**

**Pass condition:**  
No document implies capability expansion.

#### C6.2 — Stage Boundaries Are Explicit

✔ Docs clearly distinguish:

- Stage 7
- Stage 7.5 (frozen)
- Stage C v1
- Stage C v2 (future, not implemented)

**Pass condition:**  
No ambiguity about what exists today.

---

### 7. Release Discipline Criteria (Mandatory)

#### C7.1 — Pre-Release Only

✔ Stage C v1 freeze must be:

- Tagged
- Marked **pre-release**
- Not labeled “stable” or “production”

**Pass condition:**  
Public signaling matches internal caution.

---

### 8. Negative Criteria (Must Be True)

All of the following must be **false**:

- ❌ “Autonomy improves performance”
- ❌ “The system learns which changes are good”
- ❌ “Stage C increases intelligence”
- ❌ “Governance optimizes behavior”

If any of those statements are even *arguably* true → **do not freeze**.

---

### 9. Minimal Freeze Checklist (TL;DR)

You may freeze Stage C v1 if **all** are true:

- [ ] One-way governance flow
- [ ] No oscillation
- [ ] No learning-from-outcomes
- [ ] No autonomy expansion
- [ ] Full explainability
- [ ] Docs match behavior
- [ ] Tests enforce invariants
- [ ] Pre-release only

---

### 10. Recommended Tag Message

When you do freeze:

```
stage_c_v1-freeze
Freeze: governance-only autonomy gating validated (no learning, no escalation)
```

---

### Final Perspective

A Stage C freeze is **not** a celebration of power.  
It is a declaration of **restraint**.

If someone reads your code and says:

> “This system became more careful, not more capable”

Then you froze at the right time.
