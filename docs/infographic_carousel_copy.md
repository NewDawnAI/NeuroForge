# NeuroForge Infographic — LinkedIn Carousel Copy (Public Overview)

Slide 1 — Title & Tagline
- Title: NeuroForge — Substrate‑First Cognitive Engine
- Tagline: Closed‑loop validation of reward–consolidation coupling and assembly formation.
- Subtext: Public overview with protected core; outcomes without sensitive implementation.
- Alt‑text: Title card introducing NeuroForge’s substrate‑first cognition and closed‑loop validation.

Slide 2 — The Problem
- AGI needs grounded cognition: measurable internal dynamics and interpretable progress signals.
- Most systems optimize outputs; few verify substrate‑level learning trajectories.
- We focus on validating the substrate where learning happens.
- Alt‑text: Problem statement highlighting need for substrate‑level verification.

Slide 3 — Our Approach
- Substrate‑first cognition with a global workspace (Phase C) and role–filler binding.
- Closed‑loop validation pipeline linking reward signals to internal substrate changes.
- Protected‑core publishing: share outcomes and principles; keep implementation private.
- Alt‑text: Three pillars—substrate‑first, closed‑loop validation, protected core.

Slide 4 — Key Signals (Non‑Sensitive)
- Throughput (neurons/s): scalable capacity and coordination envelopes.
- Consolidation spikes: phase‑coherent events suitable for safe telemetry.
- Reward–learning coupling: measured coupling strength and lag structure across runs.
- Assembly richness: curves showing organization growth and consolidation plateaus.
- Alt‑text: Four non‑sensitive signals the platform reports and analyzes.

Slide 5 — Validation Loop
- Reward probe → Substrate dynamics → Safe telemetry → Analysis → Dashboard → Hypothesis → Next run.
- Verifies internal learning while preserving confidentiality.
- Alt‑text: Schematic of the iterative validation loop from probe to next run.

Slide 6 — Experimental Highlights (Safe)
- Winner timelines exhibit stable coordination trends.
- Richness curves show coherent growth phases and plateaus.
- Lag‑search summaries indicate non‑random coupling consistent with phase‑aligned learning.
- Alt‑text: Three highlights summarizing safe, high‑level experimental outcomes.

Slide 7 — Strategic Vision & CTA
- Vision: embodied agents, multimodal simulation platforms, cognitive services, research tooling.
- Protected Core: no code, full architecture, or data paths disclosed.
- CTA: Partners, advisors, and aligned investors—contact for NDA discussion and curated demo.
- Alt‑text: Strategic vision with confidentiality notice and call to action.

LinkedIn Post Caption (Optional)
- Copy: Building grounded cognition requires validating the substrate itself—not just outputs. NeuroForge demonstrates closed‑loop coupling between reward signals, consolidation, and assembly formation, with protected‑core publishing. Explore our non‑sensitive signals, validation loop, and safe highlights. Open to strategic partnerships and research collaborations.
