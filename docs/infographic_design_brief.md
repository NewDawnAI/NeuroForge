# NeuroForge Infographic — One‑Pager Design Brief (Public Overview)

Objective
- Create a single‑page infographic that communicates NeuroForge’s substrate‑first approach, closed‑loop validation, and safe experimental highlights—without revealing proprietary implementation.

Audience & Tone
- Audience: Researchers, engineers, product leaders, and investors in AI/AGI.
- Tone: Rigorous, concise, forward‑looking; avoid hype and avoid sensitive details.

Layout & Grid
- Page sizes: US Letter (8.5×11 in) and A4 (210×297 mm).
- Margins: 0.5 in/12.7 mm minimum; keep body text within safe area.
- Grid: 12‑column grid; use 3 columns for Problem/Approach/Signals; full‑width band for Validation Loop.
- Flow: Hero → 3‑column row → Validation loop graphic → Highlights → Vision & CTA → Footer.

Typography
- Title: 28–32 pt, bold, high contrast.
- Subheads: 18–20 pt, semi‑bold.
- Body: 11–12 pt, regular; line height 1.35–1.45.
- Font recommendation: a clean, available sans‑serif (e.g., Inter, Roboto, or system sans).

Color & Styling
- Palette: Neutral grayscale with one accent (e.g., blue #2F6FED or teal #2BBBAD).
- Use accent sparingly for headings, icons, and key callouts.
- Background: white or very light gray; ensure AA contrast for text.

Iconography & Graphics
- Signals icons: throughput (waves or nodes), consolidation spikes (pulse), coupling (link), richness (grid growth).
- Validation loop: circular or linear pipeline with 6–7 labeled steps; minimal arrows, crisp labels.
- Avoid code blocks, schematics, or data‑path diagrams.

Content Mapping (from copy)
- Hero band: Title, tagline, one‑line value proposition (protected core).
- 3‑column row:
  - Column 1: The Problem (3 bullets).
  - Column 2: Our Approach (3 bullets).
  - Column 3: Key Signals (4 bullets).
- Validation loop: Reward probe → Substrate dynamics → Safe telemetry → Analysis → Dashboard → Hypothesis → Next run.
- Highlights: 3 safe outcomes in card layout.
- Vision & CTA: Vision bullets + NDA notice + contact CTA.

Accessibility & Compliance
- Alt‑text for each graphic; avoid dense jargon.
- Minimum text contrast ratio AA; test legibility on mobile.
- Confidentiality notice near CTA; avoid revealing architecture details.

Exports & Channels
- PDF (vector) for email/press kits.
- PNG 1600×900 for web; 1080×1080 for LinkedIn carousel.
- File naming: `neuroforge_infographic_v1.pdf`, `neuroforge_carousel_v1_slide1.png` …

Copy Sources
- Primary: `docs/infographic_onepager.md` (one‑page body copy).
- Carousel: `docs/infographic_carousel_copy.md` (slide‑by‑slide copy).

Do/Don’t
- Do: emphasize non‑sensitive signals and closed‑loop validation.
- Don’t: include code, full architecture schematics, database paths, or proprietary metrics.

CTA & Footer
- CTA: Partners, advisors, aligned investors—contact for NDA and curated demo.
- Footer: Proprietary Cognitive Substrate. © 2025 NeuroForge. Patent Pending (if applicable).
