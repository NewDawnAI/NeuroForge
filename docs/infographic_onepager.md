# NeuroForge — Substrate‑First Cognitive Engine (Public Overview)

Tagline: Closed‑loop validation of reward–consolidation coupling and assembly formation — with a protected core.

## The Problem
- AGI demands grounded cognition: measurable internal dynamics, coherent consolidation, and interpretable progress signals.
- Most systems optimize outputs; few verify substrate‑level learning trajectories.

## Our Approach
- Substrate‑first cognition with a global workspace (Phase C) and role–filler binding.
- Closed‑loop validation pipeline that relates reward signals to internal substrate changes.
- Protected‑core publishing: share outcomes and principles without revealing implementation.

## Key Signals (Non‑Sensitive)
- Throughput (neurons/s): Scalable substrate capacity and real‑time coordination envelopes.
- Consolidation spikes: Phase‑coherent events suitable for safe telemetry and analysis.
- Reward–learning coupling: Evidence of coupling strength and lag structure across runs.
- Binding stability: Role–filler bindings maintain coherent temporal patterns.
- Assembly richness: Richness curves indicate organization growth and consolidation plateaus.

## Validation Loop (Conceptual)
- Reward probe → Substrate dynamics → Safe telemetry → Analysis → Dashboard → Hypothesis → Next run.
- Designed to validate internal learning while preserving confidentiality.

## Experimental Highlights (Safe)
- Winner timelines exhibit stable coordination trends over time.
- Assembly richness curves show coherent growth phases and plateaus.
- Lag‑search summaries indicate non‑random coupling consistent with phase‑aligned learning.

## Strategic Vision
- Embodied agents for interactive environments.
- Simulation platforms for multimodal cognitive testing.
- Cognitive services for learning, consolidation, and memory.
- Research tooling to compare learning trajectories across conditions.

## Protected Core Notice
- This overview intentionally avoids code, full architecture, and data paths.
- Detailed schematics available only under NDA and approved collaboration.

## Call to Action
- Open to strategic partnerships in research and product development.
- Seeking early collaborators, advisors, and aligned investors.
