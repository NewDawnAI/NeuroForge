## **The Problem**

LLMs hit scaling walls—static, energy-hungry, no true generality. We need grounded, lifelong learners that emerge from chaos like a newborn brain.

---

## **The Solution**

**NeuroForge**: Modular C++ substrate mimicking brain regions (V1, PFC, HPC) with reward-biased plasticity. Scales to 1M neurons in minutes on standard hardware; detects emergent assemblies (54% coverage) from multimodal chaos.

---

## **Key Wins**

• **Autonomous maze navigation**: Bootstraps from 0% to 70%+ success via teacher-guided emergence

• **Neural state persistence**: 100% synapse preservation for lifelong learning

• **Sparse efficiency**: 0.00019% density, 64 bytes/neuron—brain-like without supercomputing

• **Validated architecture**: Complete neural substrate with 7 integrated cognitive systems

---

## **Market Edge**

**Post-LLM alternative**: Dominates AI, defense sims, robotics, space hives. Valuation: $50M+ as-is (proven prototype vs. $12B vaporware).

---

## **Call to Action**

**Seeking strategic buyers.** Demo available under NDA.
