NeuroForge is a cognitive architecture research system focused on making internal state, internal change, and internal justifications observable and auditable over time.
It treats cognition as interacting loops—substrate learning, persistent memory, metacognitive reliability signals, self-explanation, and bounded self-revision—so that “why did it change?” is answerable from artifacts, not inference.
The project prioritizes architecture-first coherence, traceability, and safety-bounded adaptation over benchmark chasing.
Status: foundational research prototype (not a library, SDK, or product).
Scope and Boundaries
NeuroForge intentionally freezes development prior to autonomous authority escalation. Later-stage autonomy (beyond Stage C v1) is defined conceptually but is explicitly not implemented. This repository exists to demonstrate governed learning and auditable internal change, not to produce autonomous agents.
NeuroForge is a reference implementation for governed learning systems with verifiable authority constraints.
A canonical Stage 3.5 (RWCI) run under frozen Stage C v1 governance has been executed and archived, demonstrating real-world learning without autonomy escalation.
NeuroForge exposes read-only application adapters for evaluation, benchmarking, and interpretability while core governance remains frozen.
