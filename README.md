NeuroForge is a cognitive architecture research system focused on making internal state, internal change, and internal justifications observable and auditable over time.
It treats cognition as interacting loops—substrate learning, persistent memory, metacognitive reliability signals, self-explanation, and bounded self-revision—so that “why did it change?” is answerable from artifacts, not inference.
The project prioritizes architecture-first coherence, traceability, and safety-bounded adaptation over benchmark chasing.
Status: foundational research prototype (not a library, SDK, or product).
A canonical Stage 3.5 (RWCI) run under frozen Stage C v1 governance has been executed and archived, demonstrating real-world learning without autonomy escalation.
