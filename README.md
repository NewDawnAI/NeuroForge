NeuroForge is a cognitive architecture research system focused on making internal state, internal change, and internal justifications observable and auditable over time.
It treats cognition as interacting loops—substrate learning, persistent memory, metacognitive reliability signals, self-explanation, and bounded self-revision—so that “why did it change?” is answerable from artifacts, not inference.
The project prioritizes architecture-first coherence, traceability, and safety-bounded adaptation over benchmark chasing.
Status: foundational research prototype (not a library, SDK, or product).
Scope and Boundaries
NeuroForge is a reference implementation for governed learning systems with verifiable authority constraints.
A canonical Stage 3.5 (RWCI) run under frozen Stage C v1 governance has been executed and archived, demonstrating real-world learning without autonomy escalation.
NeuroForge exposes read-only application adapters for evaluation, benchmarking, and interpretability.

## Development Status
The project has moved beyond the Stage C v1 freeze. Development is now active on **Phase 6 (Hybrid Reasoning Engine)** and **M7 (Autonomy Loop)**, focusing on hierarchical reasoning, causal graph generation, and intrinsic motivation, while maintaining rigorous safety envelopes (Phase 13/15).
