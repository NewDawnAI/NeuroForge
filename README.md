# NeuroForge

NeuroForge is a neuro-cognitive research and engineering architecture that
integrates a neural substrate with symbolic language grounding, persistent
memory, and self-regulatory cognitive phases.

Unlike purely generative models, NeuroForge emphasizes:
- Causal coupling between symbols and neural plasticity
- Learning across sessions without retraining
- Interpretable internal signals (goals, coherence, trust, reflection)

## Core Capabilities
- Unified neural substrate runtime
- Episodic, semantic, and procedural memory
- Language-to-substrate attention modulation
- Reflection-driven goal coherence
- Reward-modulated plasticity

## Status
Active research system. A stable baseline is tagged as
`v0.7-stage7-closed-loop`.

## Build
```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
